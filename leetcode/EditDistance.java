/*
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2.
(each operation is counted as 1 step.)
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character

// Levenshtein distance
// a string metric for measuring the difference
// between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two
// words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions,
// deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. The
// phrase edit distance is often used to refer specifically to Levenshtein
// distance

// Another string distance measurement is Hamming distance, only allows substitions

// DP
// Let dp[i][j] stands for the edit distance between two strings with length i and j,
// i.e., word1[0,...,i-1] and word2[0,...,j-1].
// if x == y, then dp[i][j] == dp[i-1][j-1]
// if x != y, and we insert y for word1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1
// if x != y, and we delete x for word1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1
// if x != y, and we replace x with y for word1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
// When x!=y, dp[i][j] is the min of the three situations.


// word1.substring(0, i) can be converted into word2.substring(0, j) using mem[i][j] steps
// mem[i][j] = mem[i][j-1], denotes a insertion operation in word1.substring
// mem[i][j] = mem[i-1][j], denotes an deletion operation in word1.substring
// mem[i][j] = mem[i-1][j-1], denotes an replace operation in word1.substring
// time: O(m*n); space: O(m*n)
