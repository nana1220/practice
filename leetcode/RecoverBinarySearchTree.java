Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

// One way is starting from the second element in the list and comparing it with its
// previous one. If it is smaller than its previous one, then we know at least one of
// the two is in wrong spot. So, the larger one in the first pair and the smaller one
// in the second pair are the ones we are looking for.
// But, how about [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]?
// This tells us that if there is only one such pair where the latter one is greater
// than the previous one. That pair is actually the two element we are looking for.
